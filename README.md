# FalsifCPSML

## Description
A Matlab toolbox for the falsification of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulas against Simulink Cyber-Physical System
with Machine Learning components (CPSML) models. FalsifCPSML is interfaced with the deep learning frameworks Caffe and Tensorflow.

Specifically, given an STL formula \phi, find an input for the CPSML model that does not satisfy \phi.

###Models
FalsifCPSML deals with Matlab/Simulink models.


## Prerequisites

Matlab, Simulink, Caffe, and Tensorflow.

###Download
FalsifCPSML is maintained as a GitHub repository at https://github.com/tommasodreossi/FalsifCPSML
